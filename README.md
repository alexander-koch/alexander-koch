### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexander and I am currently finishing my master's degree in <a href="https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/cogsys/">Cognitive Systems</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam">University of Potsdam</a>.
The program covers the areas of computational linguistics, machine learning, knowledge representation and reasoning.<br>
I will be doing my master's thesis in machine learning, evaluating elastic transformations for data augmentation in neuroimaging.

MSc Student in <a href="https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/cogsys/">Cognitive Systems</a> at the <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam">University of Potsdam</a><br>
BSc in <a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/studium/studienangebot/info/studiengang/detail/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> from <a href="https://www.uni-hannover.de/">Leibniz University Hannover</a>

Here is a sample of projects I have been working on during my master's studies:

- [Image Captioning system + Multimodal method for image retrieval](https://github.com/yemyemyem/sempix20)
- [Higher-order Coreference Resolution with Coarse-to-fine Inference for Twitter](https://github.com/rafiberlin/e2e-coref)
- [Image Caption Generator with Neural Networks](https://github.com/rafiberlin/sose2020_image_caption_deep_learning)
- [Language model to generate fake lyrics using RNNs](https://github.com/alexander-koch/anlp-project)

I am also fond of writing compilers for fun or working with anything that has to do with 3D graphics :)
